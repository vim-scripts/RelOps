Vim 7.3 introduced an interesting functionality: relative line numbers.

The problem with Vims implementation is that you have to decide between relative and absolute line numbers;
you cant have both of them at the same time and manual switching is a nuisance.
Moreover on some computers relative line numbers might cause the screen to flicker when moving the cursor.

RelOps gives you the best of both worlds. This plugin enables relative line numbering
when it is most useful: in operator-pending mode
As soon as a motion is passed or the operation is canceled, relative line numbers
are disabled again (unless 'rnu' is set by hand).
